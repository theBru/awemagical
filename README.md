awemagical
==========

Proposition to use the class name awemagical for layouts that use calc() for dimensions.

In a not-so-recent tweetalogue with a former course instructor of mine, who thought cacl()'s are the gift of the interwebz for those who are not very adept at maths, I suggested that every element that uses calc() should have 'awemagical' as a class name.

Knowing that this will be the most onerous task, as the amount of CSS hacks required to fit the class name to every element that uses it would be immense, I propose that if calc() is used for layout purposes (e.g. grids, navigation tab etc.), then one of the class names associated with it needs to be 'awemagical' to acknowledge the awesome magical properties of this beautiful CSS trick.

This repository will create Sass mixins to show how it could be done and have a few examples of how you can add some awemagical power to your websites.

Let's make this happen!
